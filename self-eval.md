# Self-Evaluation

## This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- It felt good, I hit a small snag when I misspelled initialize, but was able to troubleshoot fairly quickly
## How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- Very well, I've been able to break my day into small sections of study, and stay on task when working
## What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- The concepts around OOP, and how to apply them to structure my code and data
